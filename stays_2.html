        <h1>Eco Resorts Coming Soon in Belize: Blackadore Caye</h1>
      </div>

        <p>
          Blackadore Caye, A Restorative Island is one of the world’s most exclusive island retreats, located in beautiful Belize behind the world’s second largest barrier reef. Originally acquired by Leonardo DiCaprio with the vision to create the future home of the greenest luxury development ever built– this vision is now a reality. Blackadore Caye is the World’s first truly restorative island development – a development completely powered by renewable energy and designed to increase the biological health of species on the island and in the waters around it.</p>
        <p>
          The project will contain a world-class luxury hotel resort centered on health, wellness and sustainability, off-the-grid ‘living homes’ a research station on climate change and habitat impacts, leading restoration programs and more.</p>

        <p>Much of this resort’s development has been kept under wraps. When it was announced Leonardo DiCaprio had embarked on the creation of an island resort here, with news of the project first emerging in 2015, it immediately rose to international prominence.

        Partnering with the owner of neighbouring resort CayoEspanto, DiCaprio set about creating a luxury hideaway that could benefit the prosperity of the surrounding environment, both on land and in the ocean. DiCaprio hopes that by developing an eco-resort that benefits the natural environment, he’ll set a model for other eco-tourism projects like these in other parts of the world.

        <h2>Sustainable Tourism in Belize</h2>
        <p>
          The resort will have a collection of energy efficient bungalows and sustainable luxury villas, alongside a main lodge with beach club, racquet club, jetty and education centre. Mangrove has been planted to stop the island’s natural erosion and native species are being reintroduced.
          The resort’s grand opening is planned for 2020 but with new information yet to be revealed, we’ll just have to wait to hear more.</p>

        <p>
          The platform that would hold the villas would shelter ocean life underneath.
          Almost half of the island would be dedicated to research alone,
          and there would a full-fledged research center on location as well.
          DiCaprio himself said in an interview at the time that his project would “change the world,”
          offering a footprint for how island resorts of the future should be like and how to thrive while helping local communities thrive, too.</p>
