    <h2>Report: Large Coursework
      <br>
      <br>
    CHEN LEYI
    </h2>

    <p>
      <b>Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement. </b>
      <br>
      The traveloka site is a travel magazine compressed into a website.
      The website is divided into different parts like a magazine would, for example, having destination, stays and food categories.  It serves the purpose of allowing readers of the magazine to have easier and more convenient access to the magazine and its content.
    </p>


      <b>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc. </b>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>I have visited other travel magazine websites and The World Travel magazine is my main inspiration in terms of the content and the structure a travel magazine should have.</li>
        <li>I have also seen other websites with beautiful user interfaces, it has inspired me to create a website that is pleasant to the eyes with good CSS.</li>
        <li>The display of each site is inspired by free CSS templates found online, the ones I have created are largely inspired by the layout of these free templates. </li>
      </ol>



      <b>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible. </b>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>The content on the sites is intentionally sectioned into their own blocks for easier reading and navigation on the page. </li>
        <li>The site also has alternate markup code for its images, for those who are not able to see and requires a screen reader. </li>
        <li>The logo is always prominently placed on the website to allow the visually impacted users to navigate back to the home page easily. </li>

      </ol>

      <b>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site. </b>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>The logo is prominently placed at the heading of all pages, and clicking on the logo brings the user back to the home page. </li>
        <li>There exists a navigation bar on top of all article pages and at the side of the home page. </li>
        <li>The style and colours are consistent for each website, it follows the theme of the subject. </li>
      </ol>

      <b>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site). </b>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Google searched fixed header and found on w3school that by using js i can do a sticky header that sticks to the top of the web page even as users scroll the page down.</li>
        <li>Google searched parallax scrolling and sourced code from w3school and applied parallax scrolling backgrounds to most of the article sides. </li>
        <li>Google searched Image Carousell/slideshow and sourced CSS and JS code from w3school to apply slideshow image in the article about Salar De Uyuni. </li>
      </ol>

      <b>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why? </b>
      <br>
      <p>I think that the path of the website jumps smoothly to its respective page. Clicking on the “Home” or the logo brings the user back to the home page (index.html), clicking on the articles link brings users to the matching article page and clicking on the categories on the navigation bar will bring users to the corresponding section in the home page.</p>


      <b>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</b>
      <br>
      <p>
        I do think that the mobile version of the website can be done differently and be on a better display than it is currently. In the future, I will look into how to fit the website and its content better to the mobile screen and consider any change that might be required regarding the flow and usability of the website on mobile devices.
        </p>

      <b>What resources were used when creating your work?</b>
