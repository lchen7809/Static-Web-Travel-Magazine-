# Year 1 static web travel magazine project

This travel magazine website was developed as part of a web development Year 1 module, involving the creation of 5 HTML pages featuring various news and articles. The project specifications included incorporating appropriate media, and interactive codes.

The website comprises one main page and five article pages. The main page features five links directing users to specific articles:

Salar De Uyuni (Destinations)
Sahara Desert (Destinations)
Blackadore Eye (Stays)
Island of Capri (Stays)
Singapore (Food)

Please note that the development of additional articles beyond the coursework requirements is ongoing. 

This travel magazine website was crafted using knowledge acquired during the web development module, supplemented by references from W3Schools (for JS and CSS) and the utilization of free templates (for the homepage and Island of Capri) sourced online.
