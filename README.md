# web-project-1

This is a travel magazine website done for a web development module in school, where they required 5 html pages with different types of news or articles. The website is expected to have appropriate media, interactive codes and some UI/UX design.
The website consists of 1 main page and 5 article pages.
Only 5 links on the main page can be directed to the article page, they are as follow:
1. Salar De Uyuni (Destinations)
2. Sahara Desert (Destinations)
3. Balckadore Eye (Stays) 
4. Island of Capri (Stays) 
5. Singapore (Food) 

The rest of the articles beyong coursewok requirements are still in development. 

This travel magazine website is created with the combination of knowledge learned from the web development module, references from w3school (for JS and CSS) and free bootstraps online.
